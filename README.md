# Food-Forecasting-Analysis-Tableau

Analysing Data for Superstore 
Use your newly acquired Tableau skills to analyse, manipulate, wrangle, and visualize the data
for a huge Superstore franchise. You will work with a dataset that covers features like product
name, categories, regions, cities, and a whole host of other variables. Learn how to create
business stories and build dashboards in this project.
Food Forecasting Analysis
Your client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various
fulfilment centres in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The client
wants to help these centres with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these 
centres will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.
The replenishment of most raw materials is done on a weekly basis and since the raw material 
is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance. Secondly, staffing of the centres 
is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are really helpful. We have the below 
information with us in the form of 3 different datasets:
o Historical data of demand for a product-centre combination
o Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount
o Information for fulfilment centres like centre area, city information, etc.
The dataset required has been provided along with this document.
You need to come up with a story in Tableau that talks about the level of demand in each
centre. This analysis needs to be granular enough to include product information as well. The
client wants an end-to-end report to understand which fulfilment areas are doing well and
which aren't. You can also talk about centre-meal combinations to add nuance to your final
submission
